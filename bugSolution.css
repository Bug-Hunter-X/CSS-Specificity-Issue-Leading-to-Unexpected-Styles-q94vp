One way to resolve this kind of specificity issue is to use the `!important` flag. However, overuse of `!important` is generally discouraged as it can make CSS harder to maintain.  A better approach involves restructuring the CSS to ensure the desired selector has higher specificity.

Here's a possible solution:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.specific {
  color: red;
}

#verySpecific {
  color: green;
}

#verySpecific.specific {
  color: purple;
}

#verySpecific.specific div {
  color: yellow !important; /* Force yellow on the inner div */
}
```

Alternatively, you could adjust the selectors or add more specific classes to achieve the desired outcome without the need for `!important`.  The best solution will depend on the overall structure and goals of your CSS.

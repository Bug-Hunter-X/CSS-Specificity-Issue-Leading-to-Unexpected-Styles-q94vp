The CSS specificity rules can sometimes lead to unexpected styling issues.  For example, consider the following scenario:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.specific {
  color: red;
}

#verySpecific {
  color: green;
}

#verySpecific.specific {
 color: purple;
}

#verySpecific.specific div {
  color: yellow;
}
```

Applying these rules to the HTML:

```html
<div id="verySpecific" class="specific">
  <div>This is some text.</div>
</div>
```

You might expect the inner `div` to be yellow, but it will actually be purple because of how specificity works in CSS. The id selector (#verySpecific) and the class selector (.specific) combined have a higher specificity than the more general `div` selector, even if they are further down the cascade.
